<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; color: red;"><span style="color: white;">B</span>eer in copious amounts didn’t help. He was stressed out, eaten alive by fear and horror. 

He told me that lately his dreams are fragmented and haunted by amber. <br> 
<span style="color: white;">I</span> haven’t told him, but I had the same dreams over and over again. <br>

<span style="color: white;">O</span>bsessive babbling went on for what seemed like ages, but I couldn't bring myself to stop him. <br>
