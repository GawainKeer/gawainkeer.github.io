<br> <span style=" font-weight: bold;">I</span> took vacation as prescpripted and left to rest in the royal oak.</span> 

<br> <span style=" font-weight: bold;">I</span>t's not far from home, but still refreshing after all the trouble <span style=" font-weight: bold;">t</span>hat recent case gave me. 

<br> <span style=" font-weight: bold;">T</span>aking xanax brought brief relief, but nightmares still haunt me. 

<br> 

<br><span style=" font-weight: bold;">T</span>here is always a chair in a dark room. I am sitting in front of <span style=" font-weight: bold;">i</span>t for hours. 

<br><span style=" font-weight: bold;">A</span>fter what seems like ages,I notice a humanoid figure almost <span style=" font-weight: bold;">i</span>ndistinguishable from the darkness around me. 

<br><span style=" font-weight: bold;">I</span>ts presence is unbearable. It judges me so much... 

<br 

<br> 

<br> 

<span style=" font-weight: bold;">M</span>rs. McCarry said it is completely normal, but I'm beginning to <span style=" font-weight: bold;">q</span>uestion her conclusions - simply because I don't trust her. 

<br><span style=" font-weight: bold;">I</span>'m almost completely sure that she wants to achieve her own goal. 

<br><span style=" font-weight: bold;">S</span>he wants to kick me out of the game just like that. 

<br>  

<br> <span style=" font-weight: bold;">I</span> know you're worried. Don't be. I just need some rest. 

<br> <span style=" font-weight: bold;">T</span>he receptionist found me this postcard. I know you like old stuff :) 

<br> <span style=" font-weight: bold;">I</span> love you so, so much!
